guidelines for contributing to an enlightenment society built on reason and logic and that promoted human progression. This editorial will explore how Franklin's autobiography helped define the American 
lifestyle and morality by promoting reason, logic, and human progression. The use of his biography highlights the ideal American lifestyle and points and ideas to accomplish it. His idealizations 
introduced American enlightenment and the progressive era, contributing to modern society.

## Franklin's Ideals and Moral Perfection

*"If you would be perfect, you must change often, Franklin, Benjamin. The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. Edited by Leonard Woods Labaree. 
Yale University Press, 1964. P. 115.”* This quote from Benjamin Franklin's autobiography supports the morals that include that humans are capable of learning and changing. 
Franklin believed that we can all learn to be better people, even if we are imperfect and self-reflection and accountability are essential for growth. As mentioned in the *“Benjamin Franklin's Project 
for Moral Perfection"* by the Bill of Rights Institute (2020) article, *"I was surprised to find myself so much fuller of Faults than I had imagined,”* Franklin wrote. However, this feeling was soon
outweighed by *“the Satisfaction of seeing them diminish.”*

## Franklin's Habit Tracking and Influence

*"I entered upon the execution of this plan for self-examination...”* This quote from Benjamin Franklin's autobiography shows his twist on self-improvement 
and the emotional appeal of becoming one's better self; his journey of implication regarding his project for moral perfection. As stated by James Clear (author of *Atomic Habits*), 
*"Franklin's habit tracking system is one of the most simple and effective ways to improve your life. It's also one of the oldest, dating back to the 18th century."* Franklin's system is 
still just as relevant today as it was when he first developed it. There are many different habit tracking apps and systems available today, but they all build on the foundation that Franklin laid.

## Virtues and Their Impact

*"These names of virtues, with their precepts were; one temperance eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation, two silence speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; 
avoid trifling conversation...Franklin, Benjamin. The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. Edited by Leonard Woods Labaree. Yale University Press, 1964. P. 115.”* This quote shows that 
Benjamin Franklin set even higher standards and expectations for human progression by highlighting 12 virtues (life rules) to live by and hold your heart to, which he would track in his 
journal to see how often he followed them and thus improved himself upon them.
