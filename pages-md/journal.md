### Introduction: (written October 22nd, 2023)
Hey, my name is Owen Dobson and I am a high school junior, in a small town. I am 16 years old, born in 2007. I hope to be an entrepreneur someday and to live in New York City. My dream school is New York University, which I hope to attend, however, I most likely cannot due to high tuition fees. I love everything about urban life, I find it inspiring, a way out of this small town, a reassurance of freedom. Some of my interests are photography, business, music (listening), hanging out with friends, IST (information systems tech), poetry, writing, reading, drinking coffee, cycling, going to the gym, academics, business, and others. I identify as pansexual, but I tell everyone I'm gay just because it's easier, I'm out which means I'm just another secret to them as I live in this small town. I work at a grocery store, in the curbside pickup department. It's okay there I guess, just a bit odd. I love cats (even though I don't have one because my dad is allergic) but I hope to get one someday and have them grow up with a husky to become the best of friends. So that's a little bit about me.

Journaling:

### 2023

### October

### Started on October 21st, 2023
Today was a nonproductive day, I slept in til 2 pm not willing because I worked a late shift the other day; totaling over 15 hours. It's a real problem. I then started to make lunch/breakfast and got a shower to get ready for my 4-8 PM shift. When I went to my shift I accidentally forgot to say hi to a coworker, now I feel bad, but anyway, it was an interesting shift, to say the least. Customers are wild. I didn't know this but apparently, you can get cash back from a check so slay I guess. I accidentally didn't realize there was a hole in the bag while doing trash and I spilled it everywhere, but my shift ended so I wasn't allowed to clean it up, cough cough labor laws. Then I came home, settled around, and stayed up til 5:20 AM which it is now. I am going to make today a productive day.

### October 22nd, 2023 - October 28th, 2023
A great week I would say. I volunteered for the FBLA club fair and was the only one running the booth and did the FBLA trunk or treat. I talked and hung out with my friends a little bit. And a guy is interested in me but I don't know their name. Men are confusing. Friday, I went to Summerset with my mom and brother to meet my grandparents for dinner. I had to work so I couldn't come with them, but my brother went with them to attend a football game at Saint Francis. I have gone before and I got this cute sweater and took pictures for my photography account. I bought me and my friend a Taylor Swift 1989 cardigan that only existed until October 30th. She was really happy about that :). Geometry is becoming hard so I now have a tutor from HACC, which is nice to be able to have someone to help me with my math. I have a few tests next week and hopefully, I can study enough. I have 20 hours of work for next week, but I had to call off a day due to an unexpected doctor's appointment. I'm starting CBT therapy with my therapist and it's going well so far!!! I have to write an essay about Rasputin, and a biography about Giuseppe Zangara, and complete other assignments for next week! The end of the marking period is coming up so I have to be careful. I'm looking forward to next week!

### November 
### October 29th, 2023 - November 10th, 2023
It's been an odd few weeks. The inns and outs of it all; are confusing, to say the least. I've been struggling with mental health recently, and I have been battling it. The Taylor Swift merch still has not arrived. I have completed all my geometry makeup work, like finally. Last Thursday I went on a field trip, to discuss finance careers and such, it was very informative. I was able to get contact information of bankers who deal with corporate financing and was able to connect with them on LinkedIn who will be most helpful to my business endeavors. I have a busy month ahead! I decided not to do the coffee house performance as I couldn't share that side of myself, without feeling embarrassed. I bought a cute journal/calendar I hope it helps.

### November 10th, 2023 to November 24th, 2023
It has been two weeks since my last entry, and I already feel so different. I don't understand, my perception of time is confusing. Anyway, I have been working on an FBLA project for the competitive events this year and I am doing business ethics. I have to take an objective test, present, interview at least three business owners/managers and create a 3 paged report on how these interviews impacted my research for this project. It turns out I might have bipolar. I am thinking about applying to the Keystone Challenge Academy for a reset. I also was going to apply for part-time service with the National Guard but my medications disqualify me from joining. I started a new medicine, to replace one I have been taking since I was 5 years old. It has helped me be able to talk to people and socialize more while providing a more stabilized mood. For ocean busters, we have been reorganizing board members and we have interviewed a few people and decided upon a few things. I have a tour with OVR at Shippensburg University next Tuesday which should be fun. Also, the FBLA regional conference is on December 5!!! I have never been able to go to one because of covid so I am so excited. It's also at Shipp U LMAO. It's been a good Thanksgiving break so far. Chaotic but fine.

### December 

### November 24th, 2023 to December 2nd, 2023
It has been an eventful two weeks. I have been doing better with my mental health and my anxiety because of my new medicine. I have been improving from my past state with idealizations in mind. I have been interviewing business owners and managers for the FBLA business ethics project, and it has been going well so far. I have interviews scheduled with public figures, business owners, education leaders, and prestigious individuals. I have obtained a media pass for Shippensburg University and have been doing activities more and being more involved. I have improved communication and transparency as well as self-care and confidence in my life; it has been most rewarding. Saying what you mean, or what your intentions are is important to ethical interactions. I went on the OVR college pathways tour at Shippensburg University, where I got to meet a lot of new people and reconnect with old ones. I am thinking about doing dual enrollment there next year if I don't go to the Keystone Challenge Academy. I have been busy with ocean busters with creating website design, planning

### December 2nd to December 16th 
Hey. I went to my first town council meeting it went well. I also went on the Keystone Challenge Academy Tour, which was amazing. It thrilled me. I didn't go to school that day and I got Starbucks and went shopping, it was so slay. I lost the Candicady to VP of fashion but at least I had the confidence to stand in front of everyone and give a no-notice last-minute  speech while the other person did it from their seat and I submitted supporting documents. I have worked a few bakery and bagger shifts which was great. I have been working on developing my venture called Solvitivo. We offer post-secondary education planning services to those students currently pursuing a high school diploma or GED. I have launched internships and things and organized operational efforts. I have cleaned out my followers/follow list to clean out my life of toxic people and past friendships. I went to the Shippensburg University Library to study for my FBLA project and I was able to get a study room. I got so much done, and I felt so happy about it. I reorganized my papers in a file box and my binder. I got a Ralph Lauren small/miniature backpack in which I organize all my stuff as my main backpack is too big to bring throughout the school (no backpack rule). I got a photoshoot of my best friend's 1st anniversary with her boyfriend so slay. 

What my calendar for next week looks like with more to come.

I am like so busy, but I like being busy so slay. 

The FBLA PA Region 26 Regionals is next Monday so like very slay. I am going to be running for Region 26 Secretary so I have to give a speech in front of about 1000 people. So slay. Somehow I am not nervous though, because I am just too slay. I am also going to present my Business Ethics Competition which I am so proud of. Anyway, I have to research meditation for therapy so I will do that by Wednesday. I am also doing an NSHSS takeover during the Regional conference. I have drama practice on Tuesday and then afterward I have to walk to the Town Council Meeting. I have an interview with John Ruane for my FBLA Competitive Event, even though I cannot finish it in time for the project it will still be interesting.
