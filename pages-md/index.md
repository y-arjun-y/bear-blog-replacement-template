My name is Owen Dobson and I attend Shippensburg Area Senior High School. In addition, I attend the Franklin County Career Tech Center for IST and the Harrisburg Area Community College for Dual Enrollment where I have taken business classes. I have started a photography and modeling freelance services venture as well as a Post Secondary Education Academy/Agency that offers post-secondary education consulting to those in a High School diploma or GED-related program. I am extensively involved throughout my local community. Feel free to contact me at [owen@owendobson.com](mailto:owen@owendobson.com) or connect with me on LinkedIn at [linkedin.com/owendob23](linkedin.com/in/owendob23).
