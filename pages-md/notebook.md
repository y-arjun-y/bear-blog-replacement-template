Objective

High School Scenario
"Jace is a software manager for Synergy Consulting, a company that specializes in information technology services and consulting. His primary responsibility at the company is integrating new programs and applications into Synergy’s processes to increase efficiency company-wide.
Synergy is always looking for new ways to innovate, and recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have motivated them to incorporate this technology into their processes. The company decided to modernize and streamline its customer service operations with an advanced chatbot called ANNETTE (Artificial Neural Network for Telecommunications Engagement). ANNETTE possesses highly sophisticated comprehension and language skills, allowing it to have complex conversations with customers.
Jace is responsible for overseeing ANNETTE’s interactions with Synergy’s clients and adjusting the chatbot’s behavioral procedures accordingly. This includes catching any errant responses, providing any missing data or information when needed, and monitoring and modifying ANNETTE’s interpersonal conduct when communicating with customers.
As the chatbot begins its role as a customer service representative, things appear to be going well. Customers have loved their interactions with ANNETTE. To make ANNETTE as “human” as possible, the chatbot is programmed to make informal conversation, talk in a casual tone of voice, and even display emotions. This programming has allowed ANNETTE and customers to form personal connections, leading to improved customer relations overall at Synergy Consulting.
However, Jace recognizes potential ethical issues with designing a charismatic chatbot. He worries that customers forming a close connection to ANNETTE will lead to a false sense of support and trust. After all, no matter how genuine ANNETTE appears, it cannot feel or demonstrate real emotions and is simply responding to prompts based on collected data. If Synergy’s clients become trusting of or vulnerable towards ANNETTE, this could lead to them divulging sensitive personal or professional information and being emotionally manipulated.
Jace raises his concerns to his department manager. He recommends modifying ANNETTE’s behavior to be much more impersonal and rigid with customers, to decrease the risk of customers being manipulated or deceived. However, Jace’s manager doesn’t seem to share his concerns. They remind Jace that ANNETTE’s personable nature is what makes it such an effective customer service representative and dialing that element back would defeat the purpose of incorporating chatbots into their business processes. Besides, they argue, even human customer service representatives run the risk of developing unhealthy personal connections with customers. Jace’s manager urges him to keep ANNETTE’s engaging personality and even floats the idea of expanding ANNETTE’s responsibilities to other roles and departments.
Next week, Jace is slated to meet with the top executives at Synergy Consulting and provide recommendations for the future of AI use at the company. What should Jace suggest to his company’s leadership? Should he recommend reprogramming ANNETTE to be more formal and transactional? Or should he recommend continuing with ANNETTE’s design as-is, knowing this may lead to ANNETTE—or other chatbots—receiving an expanded role at the company?"
